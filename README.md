# Semisizer
Semisizer is a powerful summarization app built using open-source LLMs and frameworks like Llama 2, Haystack, Whisper, and Streamlit. It efficiently processes and summarizes content while running smoothly on a CPU, thanks to the GGUF format of the Llama 2 model, loaded through Llama.cpp.
